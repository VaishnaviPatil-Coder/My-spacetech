 <h1>INTRODUCTION TO BLACKHOLE</h1>  <br> 
   <p>Many of you were wondering what is blackhole and many other questions must be raising in your mind,same my frined "Vir" was wonderingwhat is it so we both went to a astronomer and asked many questions,collected much information about blackhole so let's see what i have collected</p>

    <h1>WHAT IS BLACKHOLE?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The simplest definition of a black hole is an object that is so dense that not even light can escape its surface. ... If we squished the Earth's mass into a sphere with a radius of 9 mm, the escape velocity would be the speed of light. Just a wee-bit smaller, and the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light</p>

       <p>Albert Einstein first predicted the existence of black holes in 1916, with his general theory of relativity. The term "black hole" was coined many years later in 1967 by American astronomer John Wheeler.</p>

       <div class="collapse" id="q2">
       
       <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.</p>

    </div>
     
       <div class="collapse" id="q3">
       
       <p>A black hole can be formed by the death of a massive star. When such a star has exhausted the internal thermonuclear fuels in its core at the end of its life, the core becomes unstable and gravitationally collapses inward upon itself, and the star's outer layers are blown away.</p>    
           
       </div>

    </div>
     
       <div class="collapse" id="q4">
       
       <p>There are four types of black holes: stellar, intermediate, supermassive, and miniature. The most commonly known way a black hole forms is by stellar death.</p>

       <div class="collapse" id="q5">
       
       <p>Even light, the fastest-moving thing in our universe, cannot escape – hence the term “black hole.” The radial size of the event horizon depends on the mass of the respective black hole and is key for a person to survive falling into one. ... A person falling into a supermassive black hole would likely survive.</p>

    </div>
     
       <div class="collapse" id="q6">
       
       <p>A black hole is a tremendous amount of matter crammed into a very small — in fact, zero — amount of space. The result is a powerful gravitational pull, from which not even light can escape — and, therefore, we have no information or insight as to what life is like inside.</p>

        What is the purpose of a black hole?
        <i class="fa fa-sort-desc" ></i>
    </div>
     
       <div class="collapse" id="q7">
       
       <p>A black hole is an astronomical object with a gravitational pull so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. A black hole's “surface,” called its event horizon, defines the boundary where the velocity needed to escape exceeds the speed of light, which is the speed limit of the cosmos.</p>

    </div>
     
       <div class="collapse" id="q8">
       
       <p>two neutron stars can collide, creating an event horizon and leading to a black hole, and a dense collection of matter, either in the form of gas or a star, can directly collapse, leading to a black hole.</p>

       <div class="collapse" id="q9">
       
       <p>Yes, It's Possible to Safely Jump Into a Black Hole. But if you're going to try it, you need to know this one small catch. Scientists say humans could indeed enter a black hole to study it. Of course, the human in question couldn't report their findings—or ever come back.</p>

    </div>
     
       <div class="collapse" id="q10">
       
       <p>No. Stars like the Sun just aren't massive enough to become black holes. Instead, in several billion years, the Sun will cast off its outer layers, and its core will form a white dwarf - a dense ball of carbon and oxygen that no longer produces nuclear energy, but that shines because it is very hot.</p>

    </div>
     
       <div class="collapse" id="q11">
       
       <p>Scientists have therefore started creating artificial black holes inside labs to study their properties. And one such experiment, carried out by scientists at the Technion- Israel Institute of Technology, has proved that Stephen Hawking had been right about black holes all along.</p>

    </div>
     
       <div class="collapse" id="q12">
       
       <p>If the events of 2020 were not enough to frustrate most of us, recent data shows that Earth may be closer to a supermassive black hole than thought. Not only is our planet closer to the black hole, but the new data also shows that Earth is orbiting the Galactic Center of the Milky Way 141 miles per second faster.</p>

    </div>
     
       <div class="collapse" id="q13">
       
       <p>By their calculations, quantum mechanics could feasibly turn the event horizon into a giant wall of fire and anything coming into contact would burn in an instant. In that sense, black holes lead nowhere because nothing could ever get inside. This, however, violates Einstein's general theory of relativity.</p>
